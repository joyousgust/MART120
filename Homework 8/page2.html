	<p class="story">Deep underground, moistened by the rain, a seed opens its hard shell.  Hesitantly, unsure what it will find in the world beyond its tiny refuge, a sprout emerges.  Nourished by the warm soil, it journeys forth, pressing upwards out of an instinct it is unaware of the reason for.  For days, it makes progress unimpeded â€“ until it hits an obstacle more <b>adamant</b> than it is prepared to meet.  It presses with all its might, but its efforts seem to be in vain.  For a moment, the sprout becomes discouraged.  But, feeling the warmth in the soil, it senses it is getting closer to the source.  Then, the sprout remembers: <i>it has something to do.</i>  It twists, turns, seeks a way around the hard stony wall in its path.  It squeezes to the surface, and in the open air for the first time, the sprout spreads a pair of tiny leaves to greet the sun.</p>
